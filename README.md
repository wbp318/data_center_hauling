# Mississippi Aggregate Hauling — Data Center Construction

Business plan and market research for launching a rock/aggregate hauling company targeting the **$49 billion data center construction boom** in Mississippi.

---

## Why Mississippi, Why Now

Mississippi is experiencing the largest wave of private investment in state history. Five major data center projects are in various stages of construction across the state:

| Project | Location | Investment | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| xAI "MACROHARDRR" | Southaven, DeSoto County | $20B+ | Operational / Expanding |
| AWS | Canton & Ridgeland, Madison County | $10B | Under Construction |
| Compass Datacenters | Meridian, Lauderdale County | $10B | Under Construction (early phase) |
| AVAIO Digital | Brandon, Rankin County | $6B | Under Construction (Phase 1) |
| AWS | Vicksburg, Warren County | $3B | Pre-Construction |

These projects span **2,000+ acres** and require an estimated **3-10 million tons** of aggregate material (crushed stone, gravel, sand, fill dirt, road base) delivered on aggressive timelines. Peak demand runs **2026-2028**, with sustained hauling needs through **2033+** (Compass alone is an 8-year phased build).

## Recommended Location

**Madison County or Rankin County (Jackson metro area)**

- Central to the highest-density data center corridor (AWS $10B + AVAIO $6B = $16B within 30 miles)
- Within 40 miles of the Vicksburg AWS project ($3B)
- On the I-20 corridor connecting to Compass Meridian ($10B) — can service **3 of 5 projects** from one base
- Near major quarries: APAC (Richland), Ergon (Flowood), and river-system sand/gravel operations
- Lowest operational costs in the region (driver wages, insurance, commercial real estate)

---

## Mississippi-Specific Advantages

- **Harvest Permit** — allows hauling aggregate at 84,000 lbs (4,000 lbs above the 80,000 lb federal limit), adding ~2 extra tons per load
- **Driver wages** — ranked 50th of 50 states ($46K/yr avg), significantly lower labor costs
- **Insurance rates** — among the lowest trucking premiums nationally (~$4,664/yr avg)
- **Sales tax on trucks** — only 3% on vehicles over 10,000 lbs (vs. 7% general rate)
- **Franchise tax repeal** — scheduled for full repeal January 1, 2028
- **Climate** — 10-11 month effective working season (vs. 7-8 months in northern states)
- **Data center incentive programs** — state is actively investing in supporting infrastructure (roads, power, water)

## Key Quarry & Aggregate Suppliers in Mississippi

| Company | Location | Operations |
|---|---|---|
| APAC Mississippi/Tennessee (CRH) | Richland, MS | 10 sand/gravel ops, 1 limestone quarry, 20 asphalt plants |

**Geology note:** Mississippi's sand and gravel deposits (alluvial, from river systems) are far more abundant than hard rock. Limestone quarries concentrate in northeast MS. Much crushed stone arrives via barge from Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky.
