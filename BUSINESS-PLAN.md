## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Mississippi is experiencing an unprecedented wave of data center investment — **$49 billion across five major projects** spanning 2,000+ acres. These include xAI ($20B, Southaven), AWS ($10B, Madison County), Compass ($10B, Meridian), AVAIO Digital ($6B, Brandon), and AWS ($3B, Vicksburg). These projects require **millions of tons of aggregate material** — crushed stone, gravel, sand, fill dirt, and road base — delivered on aggressive timelines.

This creates a **generational opportunity** for a well-positioned aggregate hauling company.

### The Business

We will form a Mississippi LLC to provide aggregate and material hauling services, primarily serving the data center construction projects along the I-20 corridor and Jackson metro area. Starting with 2-3 trucks, we will scale to 10-15 trucks within 5 years, riding the sustained demand wave that will last through at least 2030.

### Financial Highlights

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fleet size | 2-3 trucks | 4-6 trucks | 10-15 trucks |
| Revenue | $300K-$500K | $800K-$1.5M | $2.5M-$4.0M |
| Net income | $40K-$100K | $120K-$300K | $500K-$900K |
| Trucks utilized | 80%+ | 85%+ | 90%+ |

### Startup Investment

- **Minimum viable start:** $150,000 (1 used truck, owner-operated)
- **Recommended start:** $250,000-$350,000 (2 used trucks or 1 tractor + belly dump trailer + 1 dump truck)

---

## 2. Company Overview

### Business Structure

- **Entity type:** Mississippi Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- **Tax election:** S-Corporation (once net profits exceed ~$85,000/year for self-employment tax savings)
- **Formation:** Mississippi Secretary of State ($50 filing fee)
- **NAICS code:** 484220 — Specialized Freight Trucking, Local

### Location Strategy

**Recommended base of operations: Madison County or Rankin County (Jackson metro area)**

Rationale:
- Central to the highest-density data center corridor (AWS Madison County $10B + AVAIO Brandon $6B = $16B within 30 miles)
- Within 40 miles of the Vicksburg AWS project ($3B)
- On the I-20 corridor connecting to Compass Meridian ($10B)
- Access to major quarries and aggregate suppliers (APAC in Richland, Ergon in Flowood)
- Lower cost of living and commercial real estate than northern MS/Memphis area
- Can service 3 of 5 major data center projects from one base

**Alternative/secondary location: Lauderdale County (Meridian)**
- Direct service to Compass $10B project (8-year build = sustained local demand)
- I-20/I-59 junction = excellent highway access
- Less competition from Jackson-based haulers
- Could be a Phase 2 satellite yard

### Mission

Provide reliable, on-time aggregate hauling services to contractors building Mississippi's data center infrastructure, with a fleet of well-maintained equipment, professional drivers, and the capacity to meet demanding construction schedules.

## 6. Competitive Advantages

### 1. Timing

We are entering at the **peak inflection point** — multiple projects are simultaneously in heavy earthwork (2026-2028), creating demand that exceeds current hauling supply.

### 2. Mississippi Cost Structure

- **Driver wages:** Lowest in the nation ($46K/year avg for dump truck drivers)
- **Insurance:** Among the lowest trucking premiums nationally
- **Franchise tax:** Being repealed by 2028
- **Sales tax on trucks:** Only 3% on vehicles over 10,000 lbs (vs. 7% general)

### 3. Harvest Permit Advantage

Mississippi's Harvest Permit allows **84,000 lbs** for aggregate (4,000 lbs above federal limit), meaning ~2 extra tons per load — a real revenue advantage over time.

### 4. Geographic Positioning

A Jackson-metro base can serve 3 of 5 major projects within 40 miles, with the Meridian project accessible via I-20.

### 5. Relationship-Driven Market

70% of hauling companies are 1-5 truck operations. By scaling to 5-10+ trucks with professional dispatch, GPS tracking, and reliable availability, we differentiate from one-truck owner-operators.

---

## 7. Operations Plan

### Daily Operations Model

```
5:00 AM — Pre-trip inspections, fuel trucks
5:30 AM — Dispatch assignments (driver texts/app notifications)
6:00 AM — First loads begin (quarry gates typically open 6 AM)
6:00 AM - 5:00 PM — Hauling operations (8-12 loads/truck/day depending on distance)
5:00 PM — End of day; post-trip inspections
5:30 PM — Daily revenue/load reconciliation
```

### Dispatch & Logistics

- **Phase 1 (Year 1):** Owner handles dispatch personally via phone/text
- **Phase 2 (Year 2-3):** Dedicated dispatcher; implement trucking management software (TruckLogics, Axon, or similar)
- **Phase 3 (Year 4+):** Full dispatch office; GPS fleet tracking; customer portal for load tracking

### Maintenance

- **Preventive maintenance schedule:** Every 10,000-15,000 miles or per manufacturer spec
- **Year 1-2:** Outsource to local diesel mechanics; build relationships with Puckett Machinery
- **Year 3+:** In-house mechanic; basic shop at yard
- **Tire management:** Retread program for drive/trailer tires; new steers only

### Yard Requirements

- **Year 1:** Lease small gravel lot or share space — 0.5-1 acre minimum
- **Year 3:** Lease/purchase 2-5 acre yard with office trailer, fueling station, basic maintenance bay
- **Year 5:** Consider purchasing 5-10 acre facility with full shop

## 10. Marketing & Sales Strategy

### This is a relationship business. Marketing = building relationships.

### Direct Sales Approach

1. **Visit quarries in person** — introduce yourself, get on their hauler list, ask about contract hauling needs
2. **Attend pre-bid meetings** — MDOT and municipal projects post bid invitations; show up
3. **Meet site superintendents** — visit active construction sites, introduce capabilities
4. **Join industry associations:**
   - Mississippi Trucking Association
   - Associated General Contractors of Mississippi (AGC)
   - Mississippi Road Builders Association
   - Local chamber of commerce

### Digital Presence (Minimal but Professional)

- Simple website with: fleet photos, services, service area, contact info
- Google Business Profile listing
- **Do NOT spend heavily on digital marketing** — this industry runs on relationships and referrals

### Reputation Building

- **On-time delivery** — the single most important differentiator
- **Clean, well-maintained trucks** — visible professionalism
- **Responsive communication** — answer the phone, return calls within the hour
- **Safety record** — clean CSA scores; display DOT compliance proudly
- **Invoice promptly and accurately** — contractors hate chasing paperwork

### Key Relationship Targets (First 90 Days)

| Contact | Company | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Hauling coordinator | APAC Mississippi (Richland) | Largest aggregate producer in MS; contract hauling work |
| Hauling coordinator | Rogers Group (MS operations) | Second-largest; diversified supply |
| Project manager | Birdsong Construction (Clinton) | Already on AWS campus; needs haulers |
| Project manager | Southern Rock Construction (Brandon) | On AWS campus; local connection |
| Superintendent | Wages Civil LLC (Canton) | Civil earthwork on data center sites |
| Project manager | W.G. Yates & Sons | GC on AWS + likely AVAIO |

## 14. Risk Analysis

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data center project delays/cancellations | Low-Medium | High | Diversify into MDOT, municipal, residential work |
| Equipment breakdown | Medium | Medium | Preventive maintenance; buy reliable brands; maintain cash reserve |
| Driver shortage/turnover | Medium | Medium | Pay above market; good equipment; consistent hours |
| Fuel price spikes | Medium | Medium | Fuel surcharge clauses in contracts; IFTA optimization |
| Payment delays from customers | High | Medium | Net-30 terms; credit checks; factor invoices if needed |
| Accident/liability event | Low | High | Comprehensive insurance; safety program; dash cams |
| Increased competition | Medium | Low-Medium | Relationship moats; reliability reputation; fleet capacity advantage |
| Quarry supply constraints | Low-Medium | Medium | Multi-supplier relationships; advance scheduling |
| Regulatory changes | Low | Low | Stay current; industry association membership |
| Economic recession | Low (near-term) | Medium | Data center projects are committed capital; long construction cycles |

### Key Risk Mitigant

The data center projects represent **committed capital** — companies like AWS, Compass, and AVAIO have already broken ground and signed utility agreements. These projects will proceed regardless of broader economic conditions. Even if one project pauses, the remaining $30B+ pipeline provides more than enough demand.
