## Aggregate Demand Assessment

### Campus Specs
- **8 buildings**, each 250,000 sq ft with 40 MW IT capacity
- **Total:** 2,000,000 sq ft / 320 MW IT / 500 MW total power
- **Build rate:** ~1 building per year over 8 years

### Construction Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|---|---|
| Project announced | January 9, 2025 |
| Groundbreaking | January 28, 2025 |
| Building 1 shell construction begins | ~November 2025 |
| Building 1 shell complete | Target August 2026 |
| Building 1 fully operational | Late 2026 / Early 2027 |
| Full campus (Building 8) | ~2033 |

### Estimated Aggregate Demand

| Phase | Volume Estimate | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Site prep & Building 1 | 50,000-100,000 tons | 2025-2026 |
| Per additional building | 40,000-80,000 tons each | Annual, 2027-2033 |
| Roads, parking, stormwater (campus-wide) | 100,000-200,000 tons | Spread over build |
| Mississippi Power substation & transmission | 50,000-100,000 tons | 2025-2027 |
| **Total campus estimate** | **400,000-800,000+ tons** | **2025-2033** |

### Demand Profile
This is a **long-duration, steady-state hauling opportunity** — not a spike. One building per year for 8 years means consistent, predictable demand. This is ideal for planning truck utilization and building a stable revenue base.

## Nearest Quarries & Suppliers

### In Meridian (Short Haul)

| Supplier | Address | Distance | Products | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **APAC-MS/TN (Meridian Yard)** | 2785 Sellers Drive, Meridian, MS 39301 | **4-5 miles** | Crushed limestone (Size 5, 57, 7, 8, 89), CR 610/DGA Base, rip rap | **#1 — MDOT approved** |
| **Vulcan Materials (Meridian Yard)** | Meridian, MS (via facility finder) | Within Meridian | Crushed stone, sand, gravel | **#2** |
| **National Site Materials** | Meridian, MS | Within Meridian | Gravel, recycled concrete, sand, clay, lime rock | Supplemental |

### Regional (Medium to Long Haul)

| Supplier | Location | Distance | Products |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rogers Group (Columbus Yard)** | Columbus, MS | ~90 miles (US-45 N) | Crushed limestone — resale/distribution |
| **Granite Construction (D&B)** | Brookhaven, MS | ~100 miles (US-11 S) | Sand, gravel (3 pits, 4 asphalt plants) |
| **APAC-MS/TN (various)** | Central MS | Varies | 12 sand/gravel operations statewide |
| **Tishomingo County Quarry** | Near Iuka, MS | ~160 miles (US-45 N) | Limestone — only natural limestone outcrop in MS |

### Critical Geology Factor

Eastern Mississippi has **very limited hard rock resources**. The Meridian area sits on Tertiary sedimentary formations (clays, sands, marls). This means:

- **All crushed stone must be railed or trucked in** from Tennessee, Alabama, or north Mississippi
- **Distribution yards** (APAC Meridian, Vulcan Meridian) are the primary local sources — they receive stone via **rail** (Norfolk Southern runs along the park boundary)
- **Sand and gravel** available from local alluvial deposits (Chunky Creek, Okatibbee Creek, Chickasawhay River systems)
- **MDEQ database** for Lauderdale County surface mines: geology.deq.ms.gov/mining/mines/

**This supply constraint is an opportunity.** Limited local hard rock means higher per-ton delivery costs, which benefits haulers with reliable capacity.

## Hauling Strategy for This Site

### Opportunity Profile

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Demand volume | High (8 buildings over 8 years) |
| Demand duration | **Exceptional — 8 years of sustained work** |
| Haul distances | Short from Meridian yards (4-5 mi); long from regional quarries |
| Revenue per load | Medium (short haul from local yards) to High (medium haul from regional) |
| Competition | **Less competitive than Jackson metro** — fewer established haulers in Meridian |
| Timeline | 2025-2033 |
| Distance from Jackson base | ~90 miles via I-20 |

### Strategic Value

This is the **best long-term hauling contract opportunity** in Mississippi:

1. **8-year build = predictable, recurring revenue** — not a boom-bust cycle
2. **One building per year** = steady aggregate demand (not a sprint)
3. **Less competition** than Jackson metro — Meridian is a smaller market with fewer hauling companies
4. **I-20 corridor** connects directly to Jackson-area base
5. **Mississippi Power substation/transmission** adds parallel demand
6. **MDOT projects in Lauderdale County** ($40M+) provide diversification

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (Year 1):** Serve from Jackson base — I-20 corridor hauling when loads are available
**Phase 2 (Year 2-3):** Establish Meridian satellite yard if securing steady contract
**Phase 3 (Year 3+):** Dedicated 2-3 trucks stationed in Meridian for Compass + local work

### Priority Actions

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Contact EMBDC** about contractor announcements and hauling opportunities | **Month 1** |
| **2** | **Visit APAC Meridian Yard** (2785 Sellers Dr) about contract hauling needs | **Month 1-2** |
| **3** | **Visit Vulcan Materials Meridian Yard** | **Month 1-2** |
| 4 | Monitor Compass Datacenters website for contractor announcements | Ongoing |
| 5 | Contact Mississippi Power about substation construction subcontractors | Month 3 |
| 6 | Introduce to National Site Materials Meridian | Month 2 |
| 7 | Identify the earthwork subcontractor when announced — this is the key relationship | Ongoing |
| 8 | Evaluate Meridian yard lease options | Month 6-12 |

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| GC/earthwork contractor not yet named | Current reality | Build quarry relationships now; be ready when contractor is announced |
| Phased build = lower peak demand | Expected | Supplement with MDOT and municipal work in Lauderdale County |
| 90 miles from Jackson base | Fixed | I-20 direct route; evaluate satellite yard for Year 2+ |
| Crushed stone supply constraints | Medium | Rail-served yards have capacity; build multi-supplier relationships |
| Compass tenant delays (data center fill rate) | Low | Campus is pre-committed to high demand from AI/cloud computing growth |
