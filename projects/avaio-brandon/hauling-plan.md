## Aggregate Demand Assessment

### Phase 1 Scope
- **600,000+ sq ft** of data center buildings
- **116 MW** contracted power (Entergy Mississippi)
- **175 acres** under active development
- **Broke ground:** September 10, 2025
- **Target completion:** First half 2027

### Phase 1 Earthwork Requirements
- Large-scale clearing and grubbing (175+ acres)
- Mass grading for building pads, parking, roads, stormwater management
- Structural fill and subgrade preparation for 600,000+ sq ft of foundations
- Stormwater detention/retention ponds and drainage infrastructure
- Utility trenching (power, fiber, water, sewer)
- Internal road construction + potential I-20 interchange improvements
- Aggregate base course for roads, pads, and parking

### Volume Estimate (Phase 1)

Using benchmark: Yates Construction managed 426,833 CY of earthwork on just 27 acres for the Outlets of Mississippi. At 175 acres, AVAIO Phase 1 could require proportionally **millions of cubic yards**.

| Component | Estimated Tons |
|---|---|
| Mass grading / structural fill | 500,000-1,000,000+ CY |
| Crushed stone (pads, base course) | 150,000-300,000 tons |
| Road base (ABC) | 50,000-100,000 tons |
| Concrete aggregate | 50,000-100,000 tons |
| Stormwater / drainage stone | 20,000-50,000 tons |
| **Total Phase 1 aggregate** | **270,000-550,000+ tons** |

### Future Phases
- **Remaining undeveloped:** ~154 acres within the 329-acre parcel
- **Full campus power target:** ~450 MW (Phase 1 is 116 MW = roughly 25%)
- **Implies 3-4 additional phases** of similar or larger scale
- **Full buildout estimate:** ~2.3 million+ sq ft of data center space
- **EMC park has 600 total available acres** — expansion beyond 329 acres possible
- **Total aggregate demand (all phases):** 1,000,000-2,000,000+ tons over 5-10 years

## Highway Routes

### Primary Routes

| Route | Description | Hauling Use |
|---|---|---|
| **I-20** | East-west interstate through EMC park | **Primary** — Exit 54 and Exit 56 provide dual site access |
| **US-80** | Parallel to I-20 through Brandon | Secondary east-west route |
| **US-49** | North-south through Jackson | Route to APAC Richland (15 miles) |
| **I-55** | North-south through Jackson | Connects to Canton/Madison County (north) |
| **MS-475** | North-south from Brandon area | Southern access |
| **MS-468 / Lakeland Drive** | Brandon to Flowood/Jackson | Local connector |

### Optimal Haul Routes

| From → To | Route | Distance | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **APAC Richland → EMC site** | US-49 N → I-20 E | **~15-20 miles** | **~20 min** |
| Canton Concrete (Pearl) → site | Local roads → I-20 E | ~8 miles | ~12 min |
| National Site Materials → site | I-20 E from Jackson | ~13 miles | ~15 min |
| Vicksburg quarries → site | I-20 E | ~55 miles | ~50 min |
| Canton suppliers → site | I-55 S → I-20 E | ~30 miles | ~35 min |

**Advantage:** Dual I-20 exits (54 and 56) = excellent truck routing flexibility and reduced congestion.

## Known Contractors

### General Contractor
**W.G. Yates & Sons Construction** — Philadelphia, MS
- **Confirmed GC** for AVAIO Taurus campus
- Also one of three GCs on the AWS Madison County project
- Mississippi-based, 60+ year history
- ENR top 50 in all delivery methods
- Earthwork experience: Outlets of Mississippi — 27 acres clearing/grubbing, 426,833 CY earthwork, 17,100 LF storm drainage

### Likely Subcontractors (from AWS project overlap)
These contractors are working on AWS Madison County and may also bid on AVAIO work:

| Contractor | Location | Specialty |
|---|---|---|
| Brasfield & Gorrie | Regional | General construction |
| Canton Concrete | Canton, MS | Concrete |
| Delta Industries | Jackson, MS | Ready-mix concrete |
| Hemphill Construction | MS | Construction |

| Waggoner Engineering | MS | Engineering |

### Key Relationship
**Yates Construction is the critical contact.** They are the confirmed GC and will be sourcing local subcontractors for site work, earthwork, and hauling. They are also a GC on AWS Madison County = potential for **multi-project relationship**.

## Hauling Strategy for This Site

### Opportunity Profile

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Demand volume | **Very High** — 175 acres Phase 1, 329 acres total |
| Haul distances | Short to medium (8-20 miles from most suppliers) |
| Revenue per load | Medium-High |
| Loads per day potential | High |
| Competition | Moderate (Jackson metro haulers) |
| Timeline | 2025-2027 (Phase 1); 2027+ (future phases) |
| Distance from recommended base | **0-15 miles** (Rankin County / Jackson metro = ideal) |

### This Is a Top-2 Priority Site

**AVAIO Brandon is tied with AWS Madison County as the top target.** Reasons:

1. **Closest to recommended base** — if based in Rankin County, the EMC is in your backyard
2. **Yates is the confirmed GC** — you know exactly who to contact
3. **Phase 1 just broke ground** (Sept 2025) — earthwork is happening NOW
4. **Multi-phase project** — 329 acres over 5-10 years of sustained demand
5. **Dual I-20 exits** make truck access excellent
6. **Proximity to AWS Madison County** (~25 miles) means you can serve both from one base
7. **APAC Richland** (closest major supplier) is only 15 miles away

### Priority Actions

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Contact W.G. Yates & Sons Construction** about hauling subcontracts on AVAIO | **Week 1** |
| **2** | **Visit APAC-MS/TN Richland** (101 Riverview Dr) about contract hauling to Brandon | **Week 1-2** |
| **3** | **Visit Canton Concrete Pearl plant** about material supply + hauling | **Week 2** |
| 4 | Contact Southern Crushed Concrete about supplemental supply | Week 2-3 |
| 5 | Contact Rankin First EDA about site contractor updates | Week 2 |
| 6 | Monitor MDEQ Rankin County surface mine permits for local supply options | Month 1 |
| 7 | Coordinate with AWS Madison County contacts (Yates overlap) for dual-project work | Month 2-3 |

## Synergy with AWS Madison County

This is a major strategic advantage. Both projects share:

| Shared Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Same GC** | W.G. Yates & Sons on both projects |
| **Same primary supplier** | APAC-MS/TN serves both areas |
| **Same corridor** | I-20 / I-55 Jackson metro |
| **Overlapping timelines** | Both active 2025-2027+ |
| **~25-30 miles apart** | Can serve both from one base with the same fleet |

**If you prove reliability on one project, Yates can deploy you on the other.** This is the single strongest argument for a Jackson/Rankin County base.

## Revenue Estimate

### Primary Model (APAC Richland → EMC Site, 15-20 miles)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Round trip | ~35-40 miles, ~70 min |
| Loads per day | 6-8 |
| Tons per load | 22 |
| Rate | $10-$15/ton |
| **Revenue per truck/day** | **$1,320-$2,640** |

### Annual Revenue Potential (2 trucks on this project)
- **Conservative:** $550,000/year
- **Optimistic:** $1,100,000/year
- **Multi-phase duration:** 5-10 years = **$2.75M-$11M lifetime potential**

### Combined AVAIO + AWS Madison County (from one base)
- 3-4 trucks across both projects
- **$1.0M-$2.0M/year** from these two projects alone

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 earthwork timeline accelerates beyond capacity | Low-Medium | Scale fleet quickly; subcontract overflow to other haulers |
| Yates brings preferred haulers from other markets | Medium | Emphasize local presence, Mississippi Harvest Permit, and reliability |
| Future phases delayed | Low | $6B commitment; Phase 1 already under construction; AI demand growing |
| Competing with AWS project for same aggregate supply | Medium | Build multi-supplier relationships; APAC has 12 operations |
| Jackson metro traffic congestion | Low | Off-peak hauling (start 5-6 AM); dual I-20 exits at EMC |
