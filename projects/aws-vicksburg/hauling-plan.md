## Nearest Quarries & Suppliers

### In Vicksburg / Warren County

| Supplier | Address | Products | Key Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **APAC-MS/TN (Vicksburg Stone Yard)** | 639 Industrial Drive, Vicksburg, MS 39183 | Crushed limestone | **Barge-served** — receives stone from APAC's Brickey's Quarry (Bloomsdale, MO) |
| **Miller Materials, Inc.** | 4111 Washington St, Vicksburg, MS 39180 | Sand, gravel, aggregate | Local family-owned (est. 1982) |
| **Watco Terminal (Port of Vicksburg)** | Port of Vicksburg, off US-61/I-20 | Aggregates (barge-to-truck transload) | 125-ton crane, bulk conveyor, truck scale |
| **Amrize (formerly Holcim)** | Vicksburg terminal | Cement, slag cement | Barge-served |

### Jackson Metro (40-50 miles east)

| Supplier | Location | Distance | Products |
|---|---|---|---|
| **APAC-MS/TN HQ** | 101 Riverview Dr, Richland, MS 39218 | ~45 miles | Sand, gravel, limestone |
| **Ergon, Inc.** | Flowood, MS | ~50 miles | Asphalt and related aggregates |
| **National Site Materials** | Jackson, MS | ~45 miles | Gravel, recycled concrete, stone |

### Barge-Delivered Aggregate

This is a **critical differentiator** for Vicksburg. The APAC Stone Yard and Watco Terminal receive crushed stone from quarries in **Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee** via Mississippi River barge. This means:

1. **Large volume capacity** — barges carry thousands of tons per load
2. **Lower per-ton cost** for stone arriving by barge vs. truck from distant quarries
3. **Last-mile truck hauling is the bottleneck** — stone arrives by barge but must be trucked the final miles to jobsites
4. **This is the core hauling opportunity in Vicksburg** — barge-to-jobsite delivery

## Hauling Strategy for This Site

### Opportunity Profile

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Demand volume | **Extremely High** — $5B+ in combined construction in one county |
| Haul distances | Short (3-10 miles from port/stone yards to jobsites) |
| Revenue per load | Medium (short haul) to High (medium haul from Jackson) |
| Loads per day potential | Very High (short-haul barge-to-site runs) |
| Competition | Lower than Jackson metro — smaller market |
| Timeline | Entergy active NOW; AWS starts 2026; port pending; MDOT 2026+ |
| Distance from Jackson base | ~40-45 miles via I-20 |

### Strategic Value

**Vicksburg is the #3 priority market** (after AWS Madison County and AVAIO Brandon), but it has unique characteristics:

1. **Barge-to-jobsite last-mile hauling** is a high-volume, steady-revenue model
2. **Entergy power plant is active NOW** (broke ground Oct 2025) — immediate demand
3. **AWS project starts 2026** — near-term ramp
4. **Port expansion levee** (3.4 million tons of fill) is a potential game-changer if funded
5. **$5B+ in overlapping construction** in one county = sustained multi-year demand
6. **40-45 miles from Jackson base** = serviceable from one base without a satellite yard

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (Now):** Pursue Entergy power plant hauling — this is the **most immediate** opportunity
**Phase 2 (Mid-2026):** Position for AWS project earthwork as contractors are selected
**Phase 3 (2027+):** Serve port expansion, MDOT projects, and ongoing AWS/Entergy work

### Priority Actions

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Contact APAC Vicksburg Stone Yard** (639 Industrial Dr) about barge-to-site hauling contracts | **Month 1** |
| **2** | **Contact Watco Terminal** about aggregate handling and hauler needs | **Month 1** |
| **3** | **Identify Entergy power plant earthwork subcontractor** — this project is active NOW | **Month 1-2** |
| 4 | Contact Miller Materials (4111 Washington St) about supply capacity | Month 2 |
| 5 | Get on bid notification lists with Birdsong, Wages Civil, Southern Rock | Month 2 |
| 6 | Monitor Warren County Port Commission for levee construction RFPs | Ongoing |
| 7 | Contact T.L. Wallace Construction (already working I-20 in Vicksburg) about hauling subcontracts | Month 3 |
| 8 | Register with Vicksburg-Warren Partnership for project updates | Month 1 |

## Revenue Estimate

### Short-Haul Model (APAC Stone Yard / Watco → Jobsites, 3-10 miles)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Round trip | ~15-20 miles, ~50-60 min |
| Loads per day | 8-10 |
| Tons per load | 22 |
| Rate | $8-$12/ton |
| **Revenue per truck/day** | **$1,408-$2,640** |

### Medium-Haul Model (Jackson Suppliers → Vicksburg, 45 miles)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Round trip | ~90 miles, ~2.5 hours |
| Loads per day | 3-4 |
| Tons per load | 22 |
| Rate | $15-$20/ton |
| **Revenue per truck/day** | **$990-$1,760** |

### Annual Revenue Potential (1-2 trucks serving Vicksburg)
- **Conservative:** $300,000/year
- **Optimistic:** $600,000/year
- **If port levee project activates:** Multiply by 3-5x (massive volume)

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| AWS project delays (still pre-construction) | Low-Medium | Entergy plant is active NOW; diversify across Vicksburg projects |
| Port levee funding not secured | Medium | Don't count on this; treat as upside optionality |
| 45-mile distance from base | Manageable | I-20 direct route; can serve from Jackson without satellite yard |
| Barge supply disruptions (river levels, locks) | Low | APAC and Watco maintain inventory; multiple supply sources |
| MS-27 congestion/safety | Medium | Use I-20 and US-61 as primary routes; avoid MS-27 with loaded trucks |
| Smaller total project ($3B vs $10B) | N/A | Offset by Entergy ($1.2B), Ergon ($400M), port, and MDOT projects |
