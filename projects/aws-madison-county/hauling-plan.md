### Geology Note
Central Mississippi **lacks abundant surface limestone**. Most crushed stone is trucked from Vicksburg (~55 mi), barged in from out of state, or comes from limited local sources. Lafarge at 139 Tyler Dr in Canton is the most proximate known source. This supply constraint = **hauling opportunity**.

## Hauling Strategy for This Site

### Opportunity Profile

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Demand volume | **Very High** — largest active construction site in MS |
| Haul distances | Mixed (3-5 miles from Canton quarries; 30-55 miles from regional) |
| Revenue per load | Medium-High (mix of short and medium haul) |
| Loads per day potential | High (short haul from Canton quarries = 10-12 loads/day) |
| Competition | Multiple contractors already on site; fragmented hauling |
| Timeline | Active now through mid-2027; Entergy plant extends to 2029 |
| Distance from recommended base | **0-30 miles** (Jackson metro base = ideal) |

### This Is the #1 Priority Site

**Madison County should be the primary target for the business launch.** Reasons:

1. **Largest active construction** in Mississippi right now
2. **Closest to recommended Jackson-metro base** of operations
3. **Known contractors and contacts** — can walk in and introduce yourself
4. **75+ companies already engaged** — hauling demand is being subcontracted across many firms
5. **No dominant aggregate hauler identified** — the work appears fragmented
6. **Entergy power plant** adds a second major demand source on the same corridor (2026-2029)

### Priority Actions

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Contact Wages Civil LLC** (chad@wagescivil.com) about hauling subcontracts | **Week 1** |
| **2** | **Visit Birdsong Construction** (Clinton, MS) — they haul 15K+ tons per pad | **Week 1** |
| **3** | **Visit Lafarge Canton** (139 Tyler Dr) about contract hauling | **Week 2** |
| **4** | **Visit APAC-MS/TN** (101 Riverview Dr, Richland) about hauling from stone yard | **Week 2** |
| 5 | Contact Southern Rock Construction (Brandon) | Week 3 |
| 6 | Contact Shackelford C&H (Yazoo City) about hauling subcontracts | Week 3 |
| 7 | Register with MCEDA for bid notifications | Week 1 |
| 8 | Attend any MCEDA or AGC networking events | Ongoing |
| 9 | Identify Entergy power plant earthwork subcontractor when selected | Month 3-6 |

## Revenue Estimate

### Short-Haul Model (Lafarge Canton → Mega Site, 3-5 miles)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Round trip | ~10 miles, ~50 min (load + dump + return + wait) |
| Loads per day | 8-10 |
| Tons per load | 22 (belly dump) |
| Rate | $8-$12/ton |
| **Revenue per truck/day** | **$1,408-$2,640** |

### Medium-Haul Model (APAC Richland → Canton, 30 miles)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Round trip | ~60 miles, ~90 min |
| Loads per day | 5-6 |
| Tons per load | 22 |
| Rate | $12-$18/ton |
| **Revenue per truck/day** | **$1,320-$2,376** |

### Annual Revenue Potential (2 trucks on this project)
- **Conservative:** $600,000/year
- **Optimistic:** $1,100,000/year

### Combined with Entergy Power Plant (Year 2+)
- Add 1-2 trucks serving Entergy earthwork
- **Additional:** $300,000-$600,000/year

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 earthwork already done | Confirmed | Remaining buildings + Entergy plant = substantial demand continues |
| Existing contractor relationships locked in | Medium | Focus on becoming a sub-hauler to Wages, Birdsong, Southern Rock |
| Community opposition (dust, noise) | Medium | Comply with all MDEQ stormwater/dust requirements; be a good neighbor |
| Congestion on MS-22/Nissan Pkwy | Medium | Use alternate routes; coordinate with dispatch to avoid peak times |
| Payment terms (Net-60 from large GCs) | High | Factor invoices or maintain 90-day cash reserve |
