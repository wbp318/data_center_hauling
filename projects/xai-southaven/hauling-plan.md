## Aggregate Demand Assessment

### Current Demand
- **MACROHARDRR retrofit:** Interior and site work — concrete pads, electrical infrastructure, cooling systems, parking, access roads
- **Power plant expansion:** Foundations for 41 permanent gas turbines, switchyard, fuel infrastructure
- **Colossus 2 expansion:** Active construction on 100-acre campus (TN side)

### Future Demand
- The $20B+ commitment vs. what's built so far implies **years of additional construction phases**
- 2 GW target requires massive additional infrastructure beyond current facilities
- Each expansion phase = more earthwork, concrete, aggregate, road construction

### Estimated Aggregate Volume
- **Current phase:** 100,000-300,000 tons (retrofit + power plant + site improvements)
- **Full $20B buildout:** 500,000-1,500,000+ tons over multiple years
- **Demand type:** Heavy on crushed stone (foundations, turbine pads), concrete aggregate, road base

## Hauling Strategy for This Site

### Opportunity Profile

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Demand volume | Medium-High (growing with expansion phases) |
| Haul distances | Very short (3-4 miles from closest quarry) |
| Revenue per load | Lower (short haul = more loads/day, less per-load) |
| Loads per day potential | **High** (10-15+ loads/truck/day at 3-4 miles) |
| Competition | Memphis metro has established haulers |
| Timeline | Multi-year (2026+, $20B not yet fully committed to construction) |
| Distance from Jackson base | ~200 miles (requires dedicated local presence) |

### Recommended Approach

**This is a satellite market — not the primary base.** The 200-mile distance from Jackson means this site requires either:

1. **Dedicated local trucks/drivers** stationed in DeSoto County
2. **Subcontracting/brokering** loads to Memphis-area haulers
3. **Waiting until fleet reaches 8-10+ trucks** before committing resources here

### Why It's Still Worth Tracking

- The $20B commitment is the **largest single project in Mississippi**
- xAI moves fast and pays to maintain schedule — premium rates likely
- The Memphis metro aggregate supply chain is mature, but xAI's pace may outstrip local hauling capacity
- If permit issues delay the power plant, alternative construction sequences may create bursty demand

### Priority Actions

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Monitor DeSoto County building permits for MZX Tech LLC | Ongoing |
| 2 | Contact Estes Grading and Trucking about subcontract opportunities | Month 3-6 |
| 3 | Introduce to Memphis Stone & Gravel (DeSoto plant) about hauling needs | Month 3-6 |
| 4 | Evaluate DeSoto County satellite yard if fleet reaches 8+ trucks | Year 2-3 |
| 5 | Contact Gresham Smith (Memphis office) for contractor referrals | Month 6 |

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Permit denial delays expansion | Medium | Monitor closely; expansion phases may shift but core facility proceeds |
| Environmental controversy slows project | Medium | xAI has shown willingness to proceed aggressively regardless |
| Memphis hauler competition | High | Differentiate on reliability and capacity; consider partnering vs. competing |
| 200-mile distance from Jackson base | N/A | Only serve with dedicated local resources or as Year 3+ expansion |
| Community opposition | Medium | Stay professional; comply with all local ordinances |
