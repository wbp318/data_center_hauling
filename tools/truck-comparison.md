### Kenworth T880 — BEST OVERALL

**Why it's #1 for aggregate hauling:**
- Best fuel economy in class (6.8-7.2 MPG from real fleet data — A&C Trucking reports)
- PACCAR MX-13 engine is proven and efficient
- Strong resale value — holds its price well
- Excellent dealer network
- Flexible — same chassis can be dump truck or day cab tractor

**Engine:** PACCAR MX-13 (405-510 HP, 1,450-1,850 lb-ft)
**Transmission:** PACCAR TX-18 automated or Allison 4500/4700 auto
**Cab:** Set-forward or set-back axle configurations; aluminum cab; ergonomic dash
**Fuel economy:** 6.8-7.2 MPG loaded (best documented fleet average)

**Known Issues:**
- Electrical/wiring harness failures
- HVAC vent doors breaking
- DEF system faults
- Hood strap failures
- PACCAR dealer-only diagnostics can be costly

**Verdict:** The safe, smart choice. Good at everything, best at fuel economy.

### Peterbilt 567 — BEST RESALE VALUE

**Why it stands out:**
- Highest resale value of any vocational truck — protects your investment
- Same PACCAR powertrain as T880 (they're sister companies under PACCAR)
- Option for Cummins X15 engine (565 HP, 2,050 lb-ft) for maximum power
- Premium interior — helps with driver recruitment and retention
- SmartLINQ telematics standard

**Engine:** PACCAR MX-13 (405-510 HP) or Cummins X15 (400-565 HP)
**Transmission:** PACCAR TX-18 automated or Allison auto
**GVWR:** Up to 100,000 lbs
**Fuel economy:** 6.5-7.0 MPG loaded

**Known Issues:**
- DPF soot buildup
- EGR blockage
- Documented MX-13 engine failure at 125K miles (warranty replacement)
- Higher new sticker price than competitors

**Verdict:** Best if you want long-term value and driver appeal. Pay more upfront, get more back at resale.

---

### Mack Granite — TOUGHEST BUILD

**Why consider it:**
- "Built like a Mack truck" is a real thing — galvanized steel cab, heavy-duty frame
- mDRIVE HD automated transmission is specifically designed for vocational duty
- Command Steer option (reduces steering effort by up to 85%)
- Lower cab height = easier entry/exit for drivers doing frequent stops
- Highest GVWR option at 150,000 lbs

**Engine:** Mack MP7 (325-425 HP) or MP8 (415-505 HP, 1,860 lb-ft)
**Transmission:** mDRIVE HD 13/14-speed automated
**Fuel economy:** 5.0-6.0 MPG loaded (slightly behind PACCAR)

**Known Issues:**
- Emissions aftertreatment module failures ($9,000 repairs reported)
- Dealer-only diagnostic software ($3,000+)
- Air pressure fluctuations
- Fewer independent mechanics can work on Mack-specific systems

**Verdict:** Excellent durability but costs more to maintain and burns more fuel. Best for extremely harsh conditions.

---

### International HV — AVOID FOR STARTUP

**Why it's cheaper (and why that's a warning):**
- Lowest new price ($199K-$232K including FET)
- A26 engine is 600-700 lbs lighter than competitors
- 70,000-mile oil change intervals

**Why to avoid:**
- **WORST reliability reputation** — owner forums report alternator, water pump, turbo, wire harness, and cam shaft failures on trucks under 2 years old
- Dealer support widely criticized
- **Worst resale value** (15-25% below competitors)
- Cummins X15 is NOT available on the HV series
- You'll spend the savings on repairs and downtime

**Verdict:** The budget trap. Cheap to buy, expensive to own. Avoid for a startup where every day of downtime costs $1,500+.

---

### Freightliner 122SD — HEAVY-DUTY SPECIALIST

**Why consider it:**
- Highest power option: Detroit DD16 at 600 HP / 2,050 lb-ft
- Highest GVWR/GCWR ratings (92,000/160,000 lbs)
- Severe-duty cab is the toughest in class
- Good for extremely heavy loads or oversized configurations

**Why it's not #1:**
- Less established in dump truck market (more common for logging/heavy haul)
- Detroit DD15 has reported cracked cylinder liner issues under 550K miles
- SCR/DEF system faults
- Not as good resale as PACCAR trucks

**Engine:** Detroit DD13 (350-470 HP), DD15 (400-505 HP), or DD16 (475-600 HP)
**Transmission:** Detroit DT12 automated or Allison auto
**Fuel economy:** 5.0-6.5 MPG loaded

**Verdict:** Overkill for standard aggregate hauling. Consider only if you need maximum GVWR/power for specialized heavy loads.

## DAY CAB TRACTORS (For Pulling Belly Dump / End Dump Trailers)

### Quick Comparison

| Spec | Kenworth T880 Day Cab | Peterbilt 567 Day Cab | Mack Anthem Day Cab |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recommendation** | **MOST VERSATILE** | **BEST RESALE** | **BEST FUEL ECONOMY** |
| Engine | PACCAR MX-13 | PACCAR MX-13 or Cummins X15 | Mack MP8HE |
| HP | 405-510 | 405-565 | 415-505 |
| MPG (loaded) | 5.0-6.0 | 5.0-6.0 | **5.5-7.0** |
| MPG (empty) | 7.0-8.5 | 7.0-8.5 | **8.0-10.4** |
| New Price | $155K-$200K | $155K-$210K | **$145K-$190K** |
| Used (2018-22) | $65K-$150K | $70K-$160K | $60K-$140K |
| Can double as dump? | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** (tractor only) |

### Mack Anthem Day Cab — RECOMMENDED FOR DEDICATED TRACTOR

- **Best fuel economy:** MP8HE engine with Energy Recovery Technology saves up to 6.5% fuel
- Test results show Anthems approaching **10 MPG empty** regularly
- **Lowest price** in the category ($145K-$190K new)
- 6x2 liftable pusher axle option saves 300 lbs and 3-5% fuel
- Purpose-built highway tractor (not a vocational chassis adapted)
- **Limitation:** Cannot be used as a dump truck — tractor only

### Kenworth T880 Day Cab — BEST IF YOU WANT FLEXIBILITY

- Same chassis can run as dump body truck OR day cab tractor
- If you're unsure about fleet mix, the T880 gives you options
- Proven PACCAR powertrain
- Slightly less fuel-efficient than Anthem as a tractor, but infinitely more versatile

## BELLY DUMP vs END DUMP — Which to Buy First?

| Factor | Belly Dump | End Dump |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | Road base, paving, controlled spreading | Stockpiling, large rock, general delivery |
| Capacity | 26-28 tons | 20-26 tons |
| Dump pattern | Windrow (controlled line) | Pile (single point) |
| Tip-over risk | **None** (gates open underneath) | **Real risk on uneven ground** |
| Max material size | 1-2 feet diameter | Unlimited |
| Speed of dump | Moderate (gate controlled) | Fast (hydraulic lift) |
| Data center use | Road base for access roads, parking, building pads | Foundation stone, large crushed rock, fill delivery |
| **Buy first?** | **Yes — more versatile for data center work** | Second purchase |

**Recommendation: Start with a belly dump.** Road base (ABC/DGA) is the highest-volume material on data center sites, and belly dumps are the standard for that work. Add an end dump as truck #3 or #4.
