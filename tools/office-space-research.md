### Vicksburg Strategy

AWS construction starts mid-2026 — getting in early = positioning before the rush. But Entergy's power plant broke ground Oct 2025, so there's immediate demand. A Vicksburg office could make sense if you land Entergy hauling work. At ~$167/month for a small office, it's basically free.
