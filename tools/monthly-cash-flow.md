|---|---|---|
| Dump truck revenue/day | $1,400 | Business plan conservative estimate |
| Tractor/belly dump revenue/day | $1,800 | Business plan conservative estimate |
| Combined revenue at 100% utilization | $64,000/month | 20 working days × ($1,400 + $1,800) |
| Working days per month | 20 | 240 days/year ÷ 12 |
| Payment mix | 70% Net 30 / 30% Net 60 | Net 30 standard; large GCs pay Net 60 |

| 5 | 65% | Reputation building, word of mouth |
| 6 | 70% | Approaching target capacity |
| 7-9 | 75% | At Year 1 target utilization |
| 10-12 | 80% | Exceeding target as relationships mature |

## Monthly Cash Flow — Base Case

| 3 | 55% | $35,200 | $30,080 | -$5,120 |
| 4 | 60% | $38,400 | $34,240 | -$4,160 |
| 5 | 65% | $41,600 | $37,440 | -$4,160 |
| 6 | 70% | $44,800 | $40,640 | -$4,160 |

| 11 | 80% | $51,200 | $50,240 | -$960 |
| 12 | 80% | $51,200 | $51,200 | $0 |

**Year 1 total revenue earned: $515,200** (vs. $576,000 at flat 75% — ramp-up reduces Year 1)
**Year 1 total cash collected: $448,640** ($66,560 still outstanding in AR at year end)

## When Cash Gets Tight

### The Danger Zone: Months 1-2

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Lowest cash balance** | **$14,307 (end of Month 2)** |
| Cash burn Month 1 | -$21,078 (zero collections, full expenses) |
| Cash burn Month 2 | -$4,615 (first collections arrive, still short) |
| Month cash turns positive | **Month 3** (+$6,816) |
| Month cash exceeds starting reserve ($40K) | **Month 6** ($52,032) |

### Why Month 2 Is the Tightest

Month 1: You haul $25,600 worth of loads but collect $0. Every dollar going out comes from your startup reserve.

Month 2: You haul $32,000 more, but only collect $17,920 (the Net-30 portion of Month 1). You're still spending faster than you're collecting.

Month 3: The payment lag catches up. You collect $30,080 (Net-30 from Month 2 + Net-60 from Month 1), which exceeds your $23,264 in expenses. Cash flow is positive from here on.

### What Could Make It Worse

| Scenario | Impact on Month 2 Cash |
|---|---|
| A large GC pays Net 60 instead of Net 30 | Cash drops to ~$10,000 |
| Major truck repair ($5,000) | Cash drops to ~$9,300 |
| Utilization stays at 30% (slow start) | Cash drops to ~$10,500 |
| All three happen at once | **Cash drops to ~$4,000** — dangerously low |

---

## Stress Test: Slow Start Scenario

**What if utilization ramps slower and more customers pay Net 60?**

Assumptions changed:
- Utilization: 25% → 35% → 40% → 50% → 55% → 60% → 65% → 70% → 70% → 75% → 75% → 75%
- Payment mix: 50% Net 30 / 40% Net 60 / 10% Net 90

| | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | M10 | M11 | M12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue earned | $16,000 | $22,400 | $25,600 | $32,000 | $35,200 | $38,400 | $41,600 | $44,800 | $44,800 | $48,000 | $48,000 | $48,000 |
| Cash collected | $0 | $8,000 | $17,600 | $22,640 | $27,040 | $30,720 | $34,080 | $37,280 | $40,320 | $42,240 | $44,800 | $46,400 |
| Total expenses | $19,478 | $20,715 | $21,264 | $24,575 | $24,554 | $25,032 | $28,761 | $29,261 | $28,761 | $30,489 | $29,989 | $29,989 |
| Net cash flow | -$19,478 | -$12,715 | -$3,664 | -$1,935 | +$2,486 | +$5,688 | +$5,319 | +$8,019 | +$11,559 | +$11,751 | +$14,811 | +$16,411 |
| **Ending cash** | **$20,522** | **$7,807** | **$4,143** | **$2,208** | **$4,694** | **$10,382** | **$15,701** | **$23,720** | **$35,279** | **$47,030** | **$61,841** | **$78,252** |

### Stress Test Findings

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Lowest cash balance** | **$2,208 (end of Month 4)** |
| Months with negative cash flow | 4 (Months 1-4) |
| Month cash turns positive | Month 5 |
| Month cash exceeds $40K starting reserve | Month 10 |
| **Risk of running out of cash** | **HIGH in Months 3-4 — one bad surprise could cause a crisis** |

---

## Minimum Cash Reserve Recommendation

| Scenario | Minimum Reserve | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Base case** | $25,000 | Covers the Month 2 low point ($14,307) plus a $10K emergency buffer |
| **Conservative** | $40,000 | What the business plan recommends — covers 60-day receivables float |
| **Stress test** | $50,000+ | If ramp-up is slow and GCs pay Net 60, you need $50K+ to survive Months 1-4 |

### The Rule of Thumb

**Keep enough cash to cover 2 full months of expenses with zero collections.**

At Month 1 expense levels (~$21,000/month without owner draw), that means:

- Absolute minimum: **$42,000**
- Recommended: **$50,000**
- Safe: **$60,000+**

## Accounts Receivable Aging (End of Year 1 — Base Case)

| Age Bucket | Amount | % of AR |
|---|---|---|
| Current (0-30 days) | $35,840 | 54% |
| 31-60 days | $15,360 | 23% |
| 61-90 days | $0 | 0% |
| **Total AR** | **$66,560** | |

Note: At 80% utilization and $51,200/month in revenue, a $66,560 AR balance represents about **39 days of revenue outstanding** — normal for Net 30/60 terms.

### Managing AR: Actions to Take

1. **Invoice weekly, not monthly** — the sooner you invoice, the sooner the clock starts
2. **Include scale tickets with every invoice** — missing documentation is the #1 reason payments get delayed
3. **Call on Day 31** — a friendly follow-up call on any invoice past Net 30
4. **Offer 2% discount for Net 10 payment** — saves you float cost, speeds cash
5. **Set up invoice factoring as a backup** — factor companies advance 80-90% of invoice value within 24 hours for a 2-5% fee. Only use this if cash gets critical.

## Year 1 Summary: Accrual vs. Cash Basis

| Metric | Accrual (Revenue Earned) | Cash (Revenue Collected) |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $515,200 | $448,640 |
| Total expenses (incl. owner draw) | $335,538 | $335,538 |
| Net income / cash flow | $179,662 | $113,102 |
| Year-end AR outstanding | $66,560 | — |
| Year-end cash balance | — | $153,102 |

The $66,560 in outstanding AR at year end will be collected in Months 13-14, providing a strong cash start to Year 2.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Month 2 is the tightest month.** Cash drops to $14,307 in the base case. Do not start with less than $40,000 in working capital.

2. **Cash flow turns positive in Month 3.** Once the first full round of Net 30 payments arrives, expenses are covered by collections.

3. **By Month 6, you've rebuilt the reserve.** Cash exceeds the starting $40,000, and from here on you're accumulating.

4. **By Month 12, you have $153,000 in cash** — enough to fund a third truck purchase without external financing.

5. **AR will always be $50K-$70K outstanding.** This is normal. Don't panic about uncollected revenue — it's in the pipeline. The concern is only if customers go past 60 days.

6. **The stress test shows you can survive a slow start**, but barely. If utilization is 25% in Month 1 and GCs pay Net 60, cash drops to $2,208 in Month 4. Have a line of credit or factoring arrangement ready as insurance.

7. **Owner draw is the shock absorber.** If cash gets tight in Months 1-3, reduce or skip the owner draw. That alone frees up $4,000-$6,250/month.
