## 1. Pricing Models

The aggregate hauling industry uses multiple pricing structures depending on job type:

| Model | Typical Rate | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Per-mile (loaded) | $1.75 - $4.00/mi (avg ~$2.50) | Long-haul delivery |
| Per-ton | $10 - $25/ton + $1-2/mi surcharge beyond standard radius | Material delivery |
| Per-ton-mile | $0.10 - $0.25 (up to $0.35 urban) | Road construction, site work |
| Hourly | $75 - $130/hr | Waiting-heavy jobs, short shuttle runs |
| Daily flat rate | $350 - $800/day | All-day site commitment |
| Per-load | $150 - $900/load | Fixed-route hauling |

### Rate Notes
- Belly dump road construction work averages ~$0.18/ton-mile
- Urban/congested area rates can reach $0.35/ton-mile
- Data center projects (high volume, schedule pressure) likely command **premium rates**
- During construction booms, rates increase 10-20% due to demand exceeding supply

- **All-in cost per mile:** $1.75 - $2.75
- **Cost per ton-mile:** ~$0.08 - $0.14

### Mississippi Cost Advantages

- **Driver pay:** Ranks 50th out of 50 states (avg $46,008/year for dump truck drivers) — significantly lower labor costs
- **Insurance:** Among the lowest nationally (~$4,664/year average trucking premium)
- **No state income tax on pass-through income** (rates being reduced, franchise tax being repealed)

## 4. Profit Margins

| Metric | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Trucking industry average net margin | 2% - 8% | General freight |
| Aggregate hauling net margin | 5% - 15% | Specialized, less competition |
| Specialized material hauling | 12% - 15% | Premium rates |
| During construction booms (current MS market) | 10% - 20% | Demand exceeding supply |
| Owner-operator take-home % | ~36% of gross | Includes their labor + profit |
| Single truck net profit | $3,000 - $8,000/month | Properly priced, steady work |
| Breakeven timeline | Month 24-34 | For new operations |

## 5. Data Center Aggregate Demand

### Types of Aggregate Needed

| Material | Use in Data Center Construction |
|---|---|
| Crushed stone/gravel | Foundations, building pads, drainage layers |
| Road base / ABC (Aggregate Base Course) | Access roads, staging areas, parking |
| Sand | Concrete production, pipe bedding, backfill |
| Fill dirt | Mass grading, pad elevation, site leveling |
| Rip rap | Stormwater management, erosion control |
| Concrete aggregate | Massive reinforced pads for servers, generators, cooling |

### Material Volumes Per Large Data Center Campus

| Component | Volume |
|---|---|
| Mass grading (earthwork) | 500,000 - 2,000,000+ cubic yards |
| Real examples (Ames Construction, SE US) | 1.07M CY, 1.50M CY, 1.85M CY |
| 1,000,000 CY equivalents | ~71,400 truckloads / ~1.2-1.4M tons |
| Additional aggregate (roads, concrete, drainage) | 100,000 - 380,000 tons |
| **Total hauled aggregate per campus** | **500,000 - 1,500,000+ tons** |

### Demand Duration

- **Heavy site prep hauling:** 6-18 months
- **Full construction cycle:** 18-36 months
- **Multi-phase campuses:** 3-7+ years of sustained demand
- **Mississippi's combined pipeline:** Sustained demand through at least 2030

### Mississippi-Specific Demand Estimate

With ~$49B across 2,000+ acres of data center projects:

- **Conservative total aggregate demand:** 3-5 million tons across all projects
- **Aggressive estimate:** 7-10 million tons (including all phases and supporting infrastructure)
- **Peak demand period:** 2026-2028 (multiple projects under construction simultaneously)

## 6. Seasonal Patterns

### Mississippi Climate Advantage

Mississippi's mild climate is a **significant competitive advantage** over northern states:

| Season | Capacity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| March - November (peak) | 100% | Full construction activity |
| December - February (shoulder) | 60-80% | Reduced but NOT stopped |
| **Effective working season** | **10-11 months** | vs. 7-8 months in northern states |

### Data Center Projects Specifically

- Run through **all seasons** due to schedule urgency
- 90-95% utilization year-round
- **Risk factor:** Mississippi gets 50-60 inches of rain annually — budget for 15-25 lost weather days/year

---

## 7. Competition Landscape

### Industry Structure

- ~28,000 dump truck companies in the US
- **Highly fragmented** — 70% are 1-5 truck operations
- Low barriers to entry, but **relationships are the key differentiator**
- Large projects prefer haulers with **fleet capacity** for guaranteed availability

### Winning Strategies

1. **Secure GC contracts directly** — build relationships with Yates, Gray, Haskell, Birdsong, Southern Rock
2. **Build quarry partnerships** — become a preferred hauler for APAC, Rogers Group, Vulcan
3. **Offer multi-truck capacity** — scale to 5-10+ trucks to win project-level contracts
4. **Invest in reliable equipment** — downtime kills reputation faster than anything
5. **Professional operations** — GPS tracking, digital dispatch, clean invoicing, on-time delivery
6. **Safety record** — clean CSA scores open doors to larger customers

## 8. Growth Trajectory (5-Year Model)

| Year | Trucks | Annual Revenue | Net Income | Milestones |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1-2 | $150K - $350K | $30K - $80K | Establish operations, first contracts, build reputation |
| 2 | 2-3 | $350K - $600K | $50K - $120K | Add truck, diversify customer base, hire first driver |
| 3 | 4-6 | $600K - $1.2M | $100K - $250K | Fleet manager role, dedicated dispatch, GC contracts |
| 4 | 6-10 | $1.2M - $2.0M | $200K - $400K | Multiple project sites, subcontracts, maintenance facility |
| 5 | 10-15 | $2.0M - $3.5M | $400K - $800K EBITDA | Established brand, long-term contracts, expansion options |

### Key Growth Metrics

- **Startup capital needed:** $150,000 - $300,000 (1-2 used trucks)
- **Breakeven:** Month 24-34
- **Total capital deployed by Year 5:** $1M - $2.5M
- **Key accelerator:** Mississippi's $49B data center pipeline = years of sustained high demand
- **Reinvestment strategy:** Use Year 1-2 profits to fund truck acquisitions, minimizing debt

### Financing Options

- **Equipment loans:** 80-90% LTV, 5-7 year terms, 6-9% interest
- **SBA loans:** 7(a) or 504 programs for equipment and working capital
- **Equipment leasing:** Lower upfront, but higher total cost
- **Owner financing:** Common in used truck market
- **Cash flow financing:** Once established, use contracts as collateral
