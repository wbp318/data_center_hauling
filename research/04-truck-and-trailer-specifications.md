- Parts availability is excellent due to Daimler's massive dealer network

**Pros for Aggregate Hauling:**
- Highest GVWR/GCWR ratings in class (up to 92,000/160,000 lbs)
- Detroit DD16 offers unmatched power (600 HP / 2,050 lb-ft)
- Severe-duty cab is among the toughest built
- Largest dealer/service network (Daimler/Freightliner)
- Competitive pricing; often $10,000-$30,000 less than KW/Pete
- Integrated Detroit powertrain diagnostics

**Cons for Aggregate Hauling:**
- Less established in the dump truck market (more common for logging/heavy haul)
- Detroit engine diagnostics can be dealer-dependent
- DD16 is heavy; reduces payload compared to lighter engines
- Interior refinement below Kenworth and Peterbilt
- The 114SD Plus may be cannibalizing 122SD sales (consider future availability)
