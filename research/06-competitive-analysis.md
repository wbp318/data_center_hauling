# Competitive Analysis: Mississippi Aggregate Hauling & Dump Truck Companies

> Last updated: February 27, 2026

---

## Overview

Mississippi's aggregate hauling market is fragmented and dominated by small operations. Manta.com lists only **44 dump trucking businesses** across the entire state of Mississippi — a remarkably low number for the level of construction activity now underway. This fragmentation, combined with $49 billion in data center construction, creates a clear supply-demand imbalance.

The competitive landscape breaks down into several categories:
1. **Dedicated hauling companies** (pure trucking/hauling operations)
2. **Civil/site work contractors with hauling divisions** (own trucks as part of broader construction services)
3. **Quarry/aggregate producers** (may do some delivery hauling)
4. **Regional/multi-state carriers** (larger operations that touch Mississippi)
5. **Owner-operators and micro-companies** (1-3 trucks)

---

## Region 1: Jackson Metro (Madison, Rankin, Hinds Counties)

This is the densest data center corridor with **$16B+ in active projects** (AWS Madison County $10B + AVAIO Brandon $6B), plus proximity to the Vicksburg AWS project ($3B, 40 miles west).

- **Competitive Threat:** LOW-MODERATE -- they have hauling capability but are small and geographically spread thin

#### K Barnes Trucking
- **Location:** Madison, MS
- **Type:** Small excavation/hauling company
- **Founded:** 30+ years experience
- **Services:** Excavation, grading, heavy hauling
- **Fleet:** Unknown (appears to be small)
- **Data Center Work:** Unknown, but located in the heart of the action
- **Strengths:** Long experience; local to Madison County
- **Weaknesses:** Appears to be a very small operation; limited web presence

#### Mighty Fresh
- **Location:** Central Mississippi (appears Jackson metro area)
- **Type:** Site services / specialized hauling
- **Fleet:** 14 specialized trucks (including septic and water haulers), ~20 employees
- **Founded:** ~2021 by Steven Rankin (after selling Rankin Rentals)
- **Data Center Work:** YES -- staffs both AWS sites seven days a week; has expanded to AWS Georgia site
- **Growth:** Started with 1 truck, now 14 trucks and growing (plans to add 2 more trucks at $150K-$200K each within 90 days)

- **Competitive Threat:** LOW for aggregate hauling specifically -- but demonstrates the growth opportunity and how quickly local companies are scaling to serve data center demand

### Summary: Jackson Metro

The Jackson metro area has **no dominant dedicated aggregate hauling company**. The market is served by:
- Civil contractors (Birdsong, Southern Rock, Hemphill, Malouf) who own trucks for their own projects
- A handful of small haulers (Solid Rock, K Barnes, Jocko)
- Aggregate suppliers who do some delivery (Mississippi Stone Co, APAC)
- Specialized haulers filling niche roles (Mighty Fresh)

**Key Finding:** The civil contractors on the data center projects need to HIRE haulers -- they are customers, not competitors. There is a clear gap for a dedicated, professional aggregate hauling company serving the Jackson metro corridor.

---

## Region 2: Meridian (Lauderdale County)

Home to Compass Datacenters' **$10B, 8-year project** -- the longest sustained demand source.

### Major Companies

#### Davidson Hauling & Construction, Inc.
- **Location:** 989 N.E. Industrial Park Rd., Meridian, MS 39301
- **Type:** Construction contractor with dedicated trucking division
- **Fleet:** 14 power units, 8 drivers (FMCSA data); ~20 employees total
- **Founded:** 1993
- **Safety Rating:** Satisfactory (FMCSA, 2000)
- **Contact:** (601) 482-1815, sm@dvdson.net
- **Services:** General contracting, heavy site work, commercial construction, material sales, trucking (construction material hauling), demolition
- **Service Area:** 100-mile radius from Meridian, into Alabama
- **Capacity:** Can handle projects up to $10M
- **Data Center Work:** Likely positioned for Compass project given proximity and capabilities
- **Strengths:** Largest local operation in Meridian area; 30+ years in business; combined construction and hauling; BBB accredited; dedicated trucking division
- **Weaknesses:** Small fleet relative to Compass project demand (14 trucks for a $10B project); limited to ~100 mile radius; aging safety review (last FMCSA review was 2000)
- **Competitive Threat:** MODERATE -- the primary local competitor in the Meridian market, but will likely need supplemental hauling capacity given the scale of Compass

#### Thompson Carriers, Inc.
- **Location:** Mississippi Terminal at 3368 County Road 8, Heidelberg, MS 39439 (~30 miles south of Meridian)
- **Type:** Dedicated dump truck hauling company (Alabama-based, MS presence)
- **Fleet:** 20+ late-model dump trucks
- **Services:** Sand, gravel, crushed stone, asphalt, topsoil, dirt hauling
- **Strengths:** Sizeable fleet of newer equipment; dedicated to hauling (not a construction company that happens to have trucks); MS terminal for local presence
- **Weaknesses:** Primary operations appear to be in Alabama; Heidelberg is south of the Compass project corridor
- **Competitive Threat:** MODERATE -- a real hauling competitor with scale, but not based directly in Meridian

### Summary: Meridian

Meridian is **significantly underserved** for aggregate hauling relative to the $10B Compass project. Davidson Hauling is the only meaningful local player, and their 14-truck fleet is insufficient for an 8-year, $10B construction project that will require massive earthwork. Thompson Carriers has a nearby terminal but is primarily an Alabama operation.

**Key Finding:** Meridian represents an outstanding opportunity for either a primary or satellite hauling operation. The 8-year Compass build guarantees sustained, predictable demand with minimal local competition.

---

## Region 3: Vicksburg (Warren County)

Home to AWS's **$3B data center** (pre-construction, starting 2026) and the **$1.2B Entergy power plant**.

### Major Companies

#### Fordice Construction Company
- **Location:** 1798 Hwy 27, Vicksburg, MS 39180
- **Type:** General/heavy contractor
- **Founded:** 1948
- **Contact:** (601) 636-5807
- **Services:** Five divisions -- Mat Casting, Bridge, Heavy, Building, Levee; earthwork, pile driving, concrete, commercial/industrial building
- **Strengths:** 75+ years in Vicksburg; deep local knowledge; diversified capabilities
- **Weaknesses:** Not a dedicated hauler; earthwork is a component of broader construction services; fleet details not public

#### Central Asphalt Co., Inc.
- **Location:** 5737 Hwy 61 North, Vicksburg, MS
- **Type:** Asphalt/paving contractor
- **Services:** Driveways, parking areas, asphalt/concrete, earthwork, drainage/levees, paved highways
- **Strengths:** Local presence; earthwork capability
- **Weaknesses:** Asphalt-focused, not an aggregate hauler; fleet details unknown
- **Competitive Threat:** LOW

#### Cullum Construction
- **Location:** Vicksburg, MS
- **Type:** Commercial construction/heavy hauling
- **Contact:** (601) 350-0145
- **Services:** Site preparation, demolition, ground leveling, dirt moving, utility trenching
- **Competitive Threat:** LOW -- site prep company, not dedicated hauler

### Summary: Vicksburg

Vicksburg has **virtually no dedicated aggregate hauling companies**. The area is served by general construction contractors who do their own earthwork. As the AWS $3B project moves from pre-construction into active building (2026-2028), there will be a massive need for haulers that the local market cannot currently supply.

**Key Finding:** Vicksburg will need to be served by Jackson-based haulers (~40 miles east on I-20) or new entrants. This represents a greenfield opportunity but one that requires covering the distance from Jackson or establishing a local presence.

- **Competitive Threat:** NONE -- this is a potential CUSTOMER and PARTNER. Their logistics email suggests they actively engage contract haulers.

### Summary: DeSoto County

V McGee Trucking dominates the DeSoto County hauling market with 60 quad-axle dump trucks -- the largest dedicated fleet in the state. However, the $20B xAI project will create demand that likely exceeds even V McGee's capacity. The remaining companies are either small haulers, excavation companies, or aggregate producers.

**Key Finding:** DeSoto County is the most competitive market due to V McGee's presence, but it is also the largest project ($20B). Memphis Stone & Gravel's local plant (800 tons/hour capacity) will need significant contract hauling. However, operating from DeSoto County would not easily serve the I-20 corridor projects. This market is best addressed as a separate opportunity from the Jackson metro base strategy.

## Market Structure Analysis

### Size Distribution of Competitors

| Category | Count (Estimated) | Fleet Size | % of Market |
|---|---|---|---|
| Large (30+ trucks) | 2-3 | 60-145 trucks | ~15% |
| Medium (10-30 trucks) | 5-8 | 10-30 trucks | ~25% |
| Small (3-10 trucks) | 10-15 | 3-10 trucks | ~30% |
| Owner-operators (1-2 trucks) | 20-30+ | 1-2 trucks | ~30% |

**Key Insight:** The business plan's estimate that "70% of hauling companies are 1-5 truck operations" is consistent with research findings. The market is highly fragmented with very few operators capable of providing reliable multi-truck capacity.

### Large Fleet Operators (30+ trucks)
1. **V McGee Trucking** -- 60 trucks (DeSoto County only)
2. **Perdido Trucking** -- 145 trucks (Gulf Coast, not focused on MS interior)
3. **Hemphill Construction** -- 39 trucks (own projects, not for-hire hauling)

### Medium Fleet Operators (10-30 trucks)
1. **Birdsong Construction** -- 25 trucks (own projects)
2. **Townes Trucking** -- 22 trucks (north-central MS, far from projects)
3. **Davidson Hauling** -- 14 trucks (Meridian)
4. **Mighty Fresh** -- 14 trucks (specialized, not aggregate)
5. **HJ Hauling** -- 11 trucks (Ohio-based, not MS)
6. **Shackelford Construction** -- 10 trucks (spread across multiple states)

### Dedicated Aggregate Haulers Serving Central Mississippi
This is the critical competitive set for the proposed business:
1. **Solid Rock Transport** -- Crystal Springs (fleet size unknown, likely small-medium)
2. **Jocko Logistics** -- Brookhaven (8 tractors, 6 trailers)
3. **Mississippi Stone Company** -- Jackson metro (delivery fleet, size unknown)

**That is it.** Three dedicated hauling operations serving the entire central Mississippi market, where $19B+ in data center construction is underway.

---

## Market Gaps Identified

### 1. Dedicated Aggregate Hauling in Jackson Metro -- CRITICAL GAP
There is no large, professional, dedicated aggregate hauling company based in the Jackson metro area. The contractors on data center projects (Birdsong, Southern Rock, Wages Civil, Malouf) all need to HIRE haulers, but the local supply is fragmented among tiny owner-operators and a few small carriers.

### 2. Meridian Market -- WIDE OPEN
With only Davidson Hauling (14 trucks) as the significant local player, the Meridian market is dramatically underserved for the 8-year, $10B Compass project. A satellite operation here would face minimal competition.

### 3. Belly Dump / Road Base Spreading
Most local companies operate standard dump trucks. There is limited belly dump capacity in the market. Data center projects require massive amounts of road base material that is most efficiently placed via belly dump trailers. This is a differentiating equipment advantage.

### 4. Professional Fleet Operations
Most competitors are either construction companies that happen to own some trucks, or small 1-5 truck operations. There is a gap for a company that combines:
- Dedicated hauling focus (not distracted by construction work)
- 5-15 truck capacity (reliable availability)
- Professional dispatch and fleet management
- GPS tracking and load documentation
- Consistent, on-time delivery

### 5. Vicksburg Market -- EMPTY
There is effectively no dedicated aggregate hauling company in Warren County. As the $3B AWS project enters construction in 2026, haulers will need to come from Jackson (40 miles) or emerge locally.

### 6. Multi-Project Capability
No single hauling company currently has the capacity and geographic positioning to serve multiple data center projects simultaneously. A company based in the Jackson metro with a Meridian satellite could serve 4 of 5 projects.

---

## Competitive Positioning Recommendations

### Differentiation Strategy

1. **Dedicated hauler, not a contractor** -- Unlike Birdsong, Hemphill, or Southern Rock, focus exclusively on hauling. This makes you a partner, not a competitor, to the civil contractors.

2. **Belly dump capability** -- Most small operators have standard dump trucks. Belly dump trailers for road base spreading are a clear differentiator, especially for data center pad/road construction.

3. **Reliable multi-truck availability** -- Contractors complain about owner-operators being unreliable. Offering 3-5+ trucks available daily, with professional dispatch, is a major competitive advantage over fragmented small operators.

4. **Jackson metro base with Meridian capability** -- No existing hauler can serve both corridors. This geographic positioning covers $29B of the $49B pipeline.

5. **Technology and professionalism** -- GPS tracking, digital BOLs, prompt invoicing, clean CSA record. Most small competitors operate with paper tickets and cell phone dispatch.

### Who to Partner With (Not Compete Against)

| Partner Type | Companies | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Quarries/Producers | APAC, Rogers Group, Memphis Stone & Gravel | They supply material, you haul it |
| Civil Contractors | Birdsong, Southern Rock, Wages Civil, Malouf | They need haulers for their projects |
| General Contractors | Yates, Gray, Haskell | They award hauling subcontracts |
| Site Services | Mighty Fresh | Complementary services, shared relationships |

### Who to Watch

| Competitor | Risk Level | Why |
|---|---|---|
| V McGee Trucking | LOW (for central MS) | 60 trucks but based in DeSoto County, unlikely to deploy to Jackson metro |
| Perdido Trucking | LOW-MODERATE | 145 trucks but based in Mobile, could pivot to MS if opportunity is large enough |
| Davidson Hauling | MODERATE (Meridian only) | The incumbent in Meridian, 14 trucks |
| New Entrants | MODERATE | The data center boom will attract new haulers; first-mover advantage matters |
| Solid Rock Transport | LOW-MODERATE | Established but seemingly small; south of Jackson |

## Key Takeaways

1. **The market is wide open.** Central Mississippi has almost no dedicated aggregate hauling capacity relative to the $19B+ in active construction. This validates the business plan's core thesis.

2. **Most "competitors" are actually customers.** The civil contractors (Birdsong, Southern Rock, Hemphill, Wages Civil) need to hire haulers. They are the demand side, not the supply side.

3. **V McGee is the only scaled competitor** with 60+ dump trucks, but they are 200+ miles away in DeSoto County and focused on the Memphis metro market.

4. **Meridian is a greenfield opportunity.** Davidson Hauling's 14 trucks are the only meaningful competition for an 8-year, $10B project.

5. **Speed to market matters.** Multiple projects are in heavy earthwork NOW (2026). Every month of delay is lost revenue that can never be recovered.

6. **Belly dump capacity is virtually non-existent** among local haulers. This is a clear equipment differentiator.

7. **Quarry partnerships are critical.** APAC (10 sand/gravel operations, largest MS producer) and Rogers Group are the key relationships. They need contract haulers and can provide steady base load work beyond the data center projects.
