## 6. Quarry & Supplier Relationships

### Business Models for Haulers

1. **Contract hauling for quarries** — Quarry hires you to deliver to their customers (best entry point)
2. **Direct hauling for contractors** — GCs/paving contractors hire you for job site delivery
3. **Broker/load boards** — Platforms like dumptruckloads.com (fill schedule gaps)
4. **Buy and resell** — Purchase aggregate, resell with delivery (higher margin, more capital)

### Major Quarry/Aggregate Operators in Mississippi

| Company | HQ | MS Operations |
|---|---|---|
| APAC Mississippi/Tennessee (CRH) | Richland, MS | 10 sand/gravel ops, 1 limestone quarry, 4 stone yards, 20 asphalt plants |
| Rogers Group, Inc. | Nashville, TN | Largest privately held US aggregates producer; MS operations |
| Ergon, Inc. | Flowood, MS | Major MS infrastructure company; asphalt & emulsions |
| Vulcan Materials | Birmingham, AL | Largest US aggregates producer; 400+ facilities |
| Martin Marietta | Raleigh, NC | 500+ locations in 30 states |
| Heidelberg Materials | Irving, TX | Major global construction materials company |

### Mississippi Geology Note

- **Sand and gravel** (alluvial deposits) are far more abundant than hard rock
- Major deposits along Mississippi River, Pearl River, and Tombigbee River systems
- **Limestone quarries** concentrated in northeast Mississippi
- Much crushed stone arrives via barge from Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky
