- **Contact:** (434) 724-9070

- **Price:** $64,950
- **Mileage:** 374,030 miles

- **Engine:** PACCAR MX-13 or Cummins X15
- **Transmission:** Various

- **Transmission:** 12-speed automatic

- **Dealer:** MHC Trucks, Jonesboro, AR
- **Source:** mhc.com

#### Listing 8: 2020 Peterbilt 567 Dump Truck
- **Price:** $67,950
- **Mileage:** 223,007 miles
- **Engine:** PACCAR MX-13, 455 HP

- **Wheels:** Aluminum
- **Dealer:** Vanguard Truck Center, Charlotte, NC

- **Contact:** (434) 724-9070
- **Notes:** County-owned truck -- these are often very well maintained with documented service records. Only 29K miles on a 2022 is exceptional. Allison auto is the top choice for dump work.

#### Listing 12: 2021 Mack Granite 64FR Tandem Dump
- **Price:** Estimated $100K-$130K based on market comps
- **Mileage:** 60,265 miles

- **Transmission:** mDRIVE automatic
- **Bed:** 14'6" Ox Body steel dump bed
- **Source:** MachineryTrader.com / TruckPaper.com

#### Listing 13: 2021 Mack Granite 64FR Tandem Dump
- **Price:** Estimated $95K-$120K
- **Mileage:** 45,911 miles

- **Transmission:** mDRIVE automatic
- **Bed:** 14'6" Ox Body steel dump bed

- **Mileage:** 86,544 miles
- **Engine:** Mack MP8, 445 HP

- **Axle Config:** Tandem rear axle
- **Dealer:** MHC Kenworth, Memphis, TN
- **Stock #:** 0617261
- **Source:** mhc.com

- **Price:** Estimated $65K-$85K (based on market data)
- **Mileage:** 385,968 miles

- **Wheelbase:** 201"
- **Source:** TruckPaper.com / TractorHouse.com
- **Notes:** Higher mileage unit. The PACCAR MX-13 is rated for 1M+ miles, so 386K represents mid-life. Would be at the lower end of pricing for a 2020 T880 day cab.

#### Listing 18: 2020 Kenworth T880 Day Cab
- **Price:** Estimated $70K-$90K
- **Mileage:** 505,135 miles

#### Listing 20: 2019 Kenworth T800 Day Cab (SOLD)
- **Price:** $137,750 (asking price before sale)
- **Mileage:** 311,000 miles

- **Source:** mhc.com
- **Notes:** Highest mileage unit in our research. At $53K, this is the budget entry point for a 567 day cab. The MX-13 engine can go to 1M+ miles. Jonesboro, AR is just across the MS state line. Would need thorough PPI (pre-purchase inspection).

- **Material:** Steel, lightweight construction
- **Features:** Air ride suspension, electric flip tarp
- **Source:** MachineryTrader.com / TruckPaper.com
- **Notes:** CPS (Construction Products & Services) is one of the leading belly dump manufacturers. The 40' ultralight steel model is the standard for aggregate hauling. At $42K, this falls right in the middle of the budget and represents good value for a 2023 model.

#### Listing 25: 2020 Puma Trailers 40'x96" Steel Belly Dump
- **Price:** Estimated $28K-$35K (based on auction data)
- **Material:** Steel
- **Features:** Spring suspension, electric flip tarp

#### Listing 26: 2019 Construction Trailer Specialists (CTS) 42' Belly Dump
- **Price:** $29,150 (contract/auction price)
- **Material:** Steel
- **Dimensions:** 42' x 96"

- **Price:** $31,350 (contract price)

## PART 5: MARKET TRENDS & ANALYSIS

### Current Market Conditions (February 2026)

**Overall Market:** The used heavy truck market has stabilized after the post-COVID spike of 2021-2023. Prices have corrected 15-25% from the peak but remain above pre-pandemic levels.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Inventory is adequate but not abundant.** There are 1,100+ Kenworth T880 dump trucks listed on TruckPaper alone, and 559+ Mack Granite dump trucks. This suggests moderate availability -- not a seller's market, but quality low-mileage units still command premiums.

2. **Price ranges are wide.** Kenworth T880 dump trucks range from $37,000 to $349,500 across all configurations and years. This spread reflects the massive difference between a high-mileage 2016 tandem and a low-mileage 2025 tri-axle. Narrowing to our target years (2018-2023) and tandem/tri-axle, the effective range is $68,500-$175,000.

3. **The sweet spot for value is 2019-2021 models with 100K-250K miles.** These trucks are past their initial depreciation cliff (the first 2-3 years where a truck loses 30-40% of value) but still have substantial useful life remaining. Modern diesel engines (PACCAR MX-13, Cummins X15, Mack MP8) are designed for 1,000,000+ mile service lives.

4. **Mack Granite holds value well.** Mack Granite dump trucks consistently command a slight premium over comparable Kenworth T880 and Peterbilt 567 models because they are purpose-built for vocational work. The integrated mDRIVE transmission and MP8 engine are factory-matched.

5. **Allison automatic transmissions command a premium.** Trucks equipped with Allison 4500 RDS or 4700 automatic transmissions sell for $5K-$15K more than equivalent trucks with manual or automated-manual transmissions. For dump work with frequent stops, the Allison is worth the premium.

6. **Day cab tractors are more affordable than dump trucks.** A day cab tractor chassis without a dump body is typically 15-25% less expensive than the same chassis with a complete dump body installed. However, you then need to budget $15K-$25K for an aftermarket dump body installation.

7. **Belly dump trailers offer the best value-to-payload ratio.** Used belly dumps from 2018-2023 are available in the $25K-$55K range and can carry 23-25 cubic yards of aggregate per load. They depreciate more slowly than trucks because they have no engine/transmission to wear out.

8. **Steel tariffs and component costs are elevated.** Section 232 tariffs on imported truck components (effective November 2025) are increasing new truck prices, which in turn is propping up used truck values. This trend is expected to continue through 2026.

9. **Southeast market is moderately competitive.** With major data center construction projects driving aggregate demand in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee, there is increased competition for dump trucks and trailers in the Southeast. However, this is offset by the large national inventory available for transport.

10. **Financing rates remain elevated.** Used commercial truck financing rates are currently 7-10% APR for well-qualified buyers, compared to 4-6% pre-2022. This increases the total cost of ownership and makes cash purchases (or large down payments) more attractive.

### Price Trend Forecast

| Equipment Type | 6-Month Outlook | 12-Month Outlook |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Dump Trucks (2019-2022) | Stable to +3% | Stable to -5% |
| Day Cab Tractors (2019-2022) | Stable | -5% to -10% |
| Belly Dump Trailers | Stable to +5% | Stable |
| End Dump Trailers | Stable | Stable to -3% |

**Rationale:** Dump trucks may see slight price pressure as new 2026-2027 models enter the market and older units come off lease. Day cab tractors have the largest supply and most pricing pressure. Trailers hold value because they have fewer mechanical components to depreciate.

## PART 7: BUYING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommended Equipment Package for Startup Fleet

Based on this market research, here is the recommended initial equipment purchase strategy:

#### Option A: Budget-Conscious Fleet ($350K-$400K total)

| Unit | Target | Budget | Strategy |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Dump Truck #1 | 2019-2020 Mack Granite tandem | $85K-$100K | Target 150K-250K miles; Allison auto preferred |
| Dump Truck #2 | 2019-2020 Peterbilt 567 tandem | $75K-$95K | Target 150K-250K miles; good availability |
| Day Cab Tractor | 2019-2020 Kenworth T880 | $70K-$85K | For pulling belly/end dumps |
| Belly Dump Trailer | 2018-2020 CPS 40' | $30K-$40K | Air ride, electric tarp |
| End Dump Trailer | 2017-2019 Hicks/MAC | $28K-$35K | Steel, standard config |
| **Total** | | **$288K-$355K** | |

#### Option B: Mid-Range Fleet ($450K-$550K total)

| Unit | Target | Budget | Strategy |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Dump Truck #1 | 2021-2022 Mack Granite tandem | $100K-$130K | Target 50K-120K miles; best long-term value |
| Dump Truck #2 | 2020-2021 Kenworth T880 tandem | $90K-$120K | Target 100K-200K miles |
| Day Cab Tractor | 2019-2020 Kenworth T880 | $75K-$85K | Memphis or Atlanta MHC dealer |
| Belly Dump Trailer | 2020-2023 CPS/Travis 40' | $35K-$50K | Air ride, electric tarp |
| End Dump Trailer | 2019-2021 MAC/Hicks | $33K-$45K | Consider aluminum for payload |
| **Total** | | **$333K-$430K** | |

### Key Buying Tips

1. **Always get a pre-purchase inspection (PPI).** Budget $500-$1,000 per truck for an independent mechanic inspection. Check frame, suspension, drivetrain, hydraulics, and dump body thickness.

2. **Prioritize Allison automatic transmissions** for dump trucks that will do stop-and-go work. The Allison 4500 RDS is the gold standard.

3. **Check dump body floor thickness.** Aggregate hauling wears dump body floors quickly. A body with less than 3/16" remaining floor thickness needs replacement ($8K-$15K).

4. **Inspect for DOT compliance.** Brakes, lights, tires, frame, and air system must pass DOT inspection. Budget for potential repairs.

5. **Consider Mack Granite for dump trucks** -- purpose-built vocational truck with the strongest resale value.

6. **Consider Kenworth T880 or T800 for day cab tractors** -- the T800 is slightly more affordable and equally capable for pulling dump trailers.

7. **Buy trailers before trucks if cash is limited.** Trailers depreciate slower, generate revenue with leased tractors, and can be financed at lower rates.

8. **Negotiate with "call for price" dealers.** Many of the best-equipped units don't list prices online. Contacting dealers directly often reveals negotiating room of 5-15% below asking price.

9. **TruckMarket.com in Olive Branch, MS should be your first stop.** They are local, specialize in low-mileage vocational trucks, and have a strong reputation. Even if their trucks are priced at a premium, the convenience and quality may be worth it.

10. **Watch auction sites for trailer deals.** Belly dump and end dump trailers from municipal/county surplus often sell 20-30% below retail at auction (Purple Wave, IronPlanet).
