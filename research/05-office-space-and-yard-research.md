# Office Space, Truck Yard & Commercial Real Estate Research — Mississippi

> Last updated: February 2026

This document covers low-cost office space, small industrial/warehouse space, truck yard/parking options, coworking spaces, and commercial real estate brokers across the four target areas for the data center hauling startup.

---

## Executive Summary

Mississippi is one of the cheapest commercial real estate markets in the country, and the data center construction boom has not yet caused significant rent inflation outside of housing. Key findings:

- **Jackson Metro / Rankin County** is the best value for a central HQ — office space runs $10-18/SF/year, coworking from $99-525/month, and Craigslist has flex office/warehouse combos under $1,000/month
- **Meridian** has rock-bottom industrial rates ($0.60-2.17/SF/month) with warehouse space near the Compass site
- **Vicksburg** is the cheapest office market at ~$10/SF/year; the AWS project hasn't started construction yet (2026 start)
- **Southaven/DeSoto County** has the most industrial inventory but is pricier at ~$15/SF average; proximity to Memphis drives costs up
- **Truck parking** runs $39-175/month depending on location and amenities
- **Bare land** for a truck yard is very affordable in MS — commercial lots run $3.50-10/SF/year in suburban Jackson

**Recommended approach:** Start with a coworking desk or ultra-cheap Craigslist office ($99-350/month) in the Jackson Metro area (Flowood, Pearl, or Brandon), and use Kingpin Parking or Neighbor.com for initial truck parking ($175/month per truck). Total startup overhead: under $500/month for office + one truck parking spot.

## Area 1: Jackson Metro / Rankin County / Madison County (PRIORITY)

### Why This Area
Central to 3 of 5 data center projects:
- **AWS Canton & Ridgeland** (Madison County) — under construction, 6,000-7,000 workers through 2027
- **AVAIO Digital Taurus** (Brandon, Rankin County) — Phase 1 under construction, complete H1 2027
- Also within ~45 min of Vicksburg (AWS) and ~2 hrs of Meridian (Compass)

### Office Space Listings & Pricing

#### Average Market Rates (Jackson Metro)
| Type | Rate | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Class A Office | ~$18-22/SF/year | Downtown Jackson, Ridgeland |
| Class B Office | ~$12-16/SF/year | Flowood, Pearl, Brandon |
| Retail/Flex | ~$10-14/SF/year | Strip centers, flex buildings |
| Industrial/Warehouse | ~$3.50-8/SF/year | Pearl, Brandon, Richland |

**For 200-500 SF of cheap office space, expect $200-600/month in the suburbs.**

## Data Center Boom — Commercial Development Impact

### Current Ripple Effects (as of Feb 2026)
The data center investments are creating secondary economic activity across Mississippi:

- **Housing/rental markets** — pressure increasing in Madison County, DeSoto County, and Lauderdale County
- **Restaurants and supermarkets** — increased demand from construction workforce
- **75+ Mississippi companies** engaged in AWS construction alone (Canton/Ridgeland)
- **Thousands of construction workers** — electricians, HVAC techs, site workers creating demand for services
- **Suppliers and manufacturers** transforming Mississippi into infrastructure supply chain hub

### What This Means for Us
- **Canton/Ridgeland (AWS):** Most active construction site — 6,000-7,000 workers. Commercial services are growing but the area was already semi-developed (Nissan plant nearby). Best opportunity for hauling demand NOW.
- **Brandon (AVAIO):** Phase 1 construction underway at East Metro Industrial Park. Area is developing; space still available and affordable.
- **Meridian (Compass):** Just broke ground. Earliest stage = cheapest real estate. Long 8-year build-out means sustained demand. Meridian is a smaller town — less competition.
- **Vicksburg (AWS):** Pre-construction (starts 2026). Getting in early here means establishing relationships before the rush.
- **Southaven (xAI):** Already operational. More competitive. Memphis metro spillover means higher costs. Lower priority for HQ but active hauling opportunity.

### New Commercial Development Emerging
- Madison County: New commercial development following $29M infrastructure investment at megasite
- Vicksburg: Entergy building $1.2B power plant — additional construction activity
- Meridian: Mississippi Power infrastructure upgrades; MSU engagement
- DeSoto County: Continued I-55 corridor industrial development
